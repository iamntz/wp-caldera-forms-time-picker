## What is this?

Caldera forms is missing a time picker, providing instead only a date picker. This plugin will **REPLACE** the existing datepicker and will add the ability to use a time picker as well. I'm using the **awesome** plugin [flatpickr][flatpickr] for the frontend and shamelessly stealed most of the backend config from the Caldera's built in date picker.


#### Todo
- [ ] Add JS hooks for each field;
- [ ] Tweak settings a bit (e.g. hide start/end dates when only timepicker is active);
